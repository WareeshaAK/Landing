									<p>Embracing A Journey in Engineering and Growth</p>
										
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-7 col-12-medium">
									<p>“What do you want to be when you grow older?” they said. “An engineer,” I replied. 
										As far back as I can remember that has always been my answer. Maybe, I have added
										in a few professions but becoming an engineer has always been a constant. Even 
										now, that I have my degree, my answer has not changed, becoming an engineer is 
										a life-long process. There is so much I can venture into, so much I can learn
										from; an endless cycle with a different start and end point.</p>
									<p>Much like everyone else, it was hard for me to make sense of a world where the colour 
										grey could exist and not just exist but to have a personality of its own; a thriving 
										ambience. That is exactly where I want to be – the lesser known densely populated grey 
										area – constantly growing.</p>

									<h2>FROM DETOURS TO DISCOVERIES</h2>
									<p>Finding Resilience and Growth in Every Path Taken</p>	
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-7 col-12-medium">
									<p>Four years ago, I wanted to become a petroleum engineer and I thought the only way to become 
										one was by getting a bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering. My understanding was that 
										the shortest path between two points is the direct length between those two points. Even 
										though I could almost picture myself graduating with a BS in Petroleum Engineering, I had 
										to cut my dream short. I enrolled in a program that cannot be closely or loosely linked 
										to Petroleum Engineering. </p>
									<p>Three months into my degree, I had an epiphany — one that I'm grateful 
										for — the colour grey has a thriving ambience. It does not matter if I have to take a longer path, 
										it does not matter if I have to change my path entirely, as long as I'm persistent and resilient 
										in what I do. Nothing else matters. There is quote in a book I once read “sometimes the only way to learn is to live” I think that 
										the only times we do actually learn is when we live through our experiences.</p>
